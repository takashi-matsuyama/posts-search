This plugin is simple. You can search posts by taxonomy terms and post type with Ajax with just a shortcode.

For example, in `header.php` add `<?php if( shortcode_exists( 'ccc_posts_search_searchform' ) ) { echo do_shortcode('[ccc_posts_search_searchform placeholder=""]'); } ? >`.

* **Shortcode:** `[ccc_posts_search_results posts_per_page="" search_keyword="" style=""]`

For example, in `search.php` add `<?php if( shortcode_exists( 'ccc_posts_search_results' ) ) { echo do_shortcode('[ccc_posts_search_results posts_per_page=" 15" search_keyword="false"]'); } ? >`.

Detailed usage is under preparation.
